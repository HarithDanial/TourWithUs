# TourWithUs

### **Project Description**
<p> This project is about bringing ideas for our project which is the online travel and tour website for the user who wants to have the best experience in their travels or holidays. This is because we identify that many people are having some difficulties getting information about the place they want to go and it is hard to find a valuable and affordable vacation for their travels and holidays.
	Our project title is TourWithUs which suits our objectives to ensure that people will get the best experiences from our valuable packages and get information about some destination first before deciding to book any package from us. Our website will include information about some destinations in Asia, for example Malaysia, Indonesia. This will help people to get some knowledge about the destinations like its history, specialty, and uniqueness of countries in Asia. We also will include the packages with some information, duration, services and offer an affordable price. Next, our contact also will be included so that people can easily reach out to us for any help or support regarding the destinations, packages or about our website. Our website also dominated with blue color as a background and navigation color. This will make people have feelings of being surrounded by a comforting blue sky and a nurturing scene .
	In conclusion, our main goal is to build a website for tourism which is simple and user-friendly yet attractive to the user. Secondly, people can get some knowledge about any destinations that we provide on our website so they can choose wisely for their next vacation. Lastly, we want to facilitate people to have an online booking for their vacation instead of dealing with any travel agency physically face to face.
